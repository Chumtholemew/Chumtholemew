- I'm 18, so please be aware of that & only int if you're at least 15+.
- Literally the #1 FBACC FAN EVER !! MY FAVE THING EVER ^_^ 
- Mineta is my fave MHA character, if it's not obvious. You're 100% still allowed to int if you hate him, idc at all. But do NOT try to argue on if it's "ethical" or not to like him..I promise you it's not that deep.                                               
+I don't like him for anything gross, to be clear. I think he's funny when he's given real jokes(*"Midoriya, you got none! They must've been grossed out by the crazy way you were fighting!*"), among other reasons.
- I don't have a dni, I'll jst hide/block. But cuz I've seen a lot of weird ppl on the game I feel the need to mention if u ship child/adult or incest stuff, I'm hiding you, no exceptions. 
- And that's all really.
