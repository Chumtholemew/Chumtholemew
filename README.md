- !! I'm 18, so please be aware of that & only int if you're at least 15+ !!
- Literally the #1 FBACC FAN EVER !! MY FAVE THING EVER ^_^ 
- You're 100% still allowed to int if you hate Mineta, idc at all. But do NOT try to argue on if it's "ethical" or not to like him..I promise you it's not that deep.                                               
+I don't like him for anything gross, to be clear. I think he's funny when he's given real jokes(*"Midoriya, you got none! I bet everyone was really grossed out by the crazy way you were fighting*"), among other reasons why he's my favorite MHA character.
- I don't have a dni, I'll jst hide/block. But cuz I've seen a lot of weird ppl on the game I feel the need to mention if u ship child/adult or incest stuff, I'm hiding you, no exceptions. Aside from gross stuff like that, though, never be afraid to interact!! I'll always be willing to talk.
- And that's all really. I only really made this cuz I wanna find other MHA fans within an 15-21 age range. So if that applies to you. Hi!!
